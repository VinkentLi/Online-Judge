# Online Judge
Creates a judge for problems similar to USACO or IOI
## How to set up
NOTE: You **need** to run this on Linux, so make sure you have Linux
1. Install [isolate](https://github.com/ioi/isolate) (if you have a debian-based linux distro, you should create a debian package to install it)
   a. Make sure you run isolate.service which can be found in the systemmd folder
2. Set up node by running `npm install`
3. Run `sudo node server.js` to initialize the server
4. The test problem can be found in `localhost:3000/problems/test/`
## How to make a problem
1. Add a folder to the `problems` folder
2. copy and paste the `index.html` and `script.js` files from the `test` folder into that folder
3. Modify `index.html` to change the problem statement
4. Modify `script.js` to set the number of testcases you have **(make sure you don't mess this up)**
5. For each testcase, **name them in this format**: `[testcaseNumber].in` for input, `[testcaseNumber].out` for output. testcaseNumber is one-indexed
6. Create a `submissions` folder to host submissions
## If you're hosting the grading server on a different server from the website
1. You will need to split the problem folder between the grading server and the website
2. Both the grading server and the website should have a similar folder structure (as described in [How to make a problem](#how-to-make-a-problem)). **If you don't have folders for a problem in both servers, you're gonna have issues with the problems list**
3. On the grading server, you need `server.js`, `judge.js`, `problems/[problemName]/submissions/`, and`problems/[problemName]/testcases/`
4. On the website, you need everything in the `problems` folder that's not on the grading server
5. In `getServer.js`, **replace server with where you're hosting the grading server or it won't work**
